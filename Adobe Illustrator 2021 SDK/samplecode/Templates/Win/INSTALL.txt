The default installation folder, <VS>, is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\<*version>\Enterprise\Common7\IDE.

1. Quit Visual Studio if it is running.
2. Copy IllustratorSDKdefault.vcxproj to <VS>\VC\VCWizards\.
3. Copy the folder <SDK>\samplecode\Templates\Win\IllustratorSDK\ to
<VS>\VC\VCWizards\AppWiz\.
4. Copy the file IllustratorSDK.vsz to <VS>\VC\vcprojects\ (Note: Create vcprojects folder if it doesnt exist already).
5. Open the IllustratorSDK.vsz in any text editor and check for "Wizard=VsWizard.VsWizardEngine.xx.x", the xx.x should match with internal version of installed visual studio, For eg. 15.0 is internal version for visual studio 2017.
6. Create a new folder <VS>\VC\vcprojects\IllustratorSDK\, and copy the file
IllustratorSDK.vsdir into the new folder.
7. Start Visual Studio.
8. Choose File > New > Project.

10. In the Templates pane, select SDKProject.
11. Set the Name of the project to a name of your choice.
12. Set the Location of the project to the <SDK>\samplecode folder. (If you save to a different location, you
will have to update the relative paths.)
13. Ensure Create Directory For Solution is not checked. (If this option is selected, the relative paths will
have to be updated, as the project file will not be at the top level.)
14. Click OK.
15. Build the project and load it into Illustrator. See “Build the project” in “Creating a plug-in in Windows” in the getting started guide.
